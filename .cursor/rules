# Cursor Rules

## Prompt Tracking Rule
**Every prompt written by the user must be saved to prompts.md**

- When a user creates or writes a prompt, automatically add it to the prompts.md file
- Include the date, purpose, and full prompt content
- Organize prompts by category or date for easy reference
- Maintain a comprehensive record of all prompts created during the project

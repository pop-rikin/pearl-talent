## Service-Specific Pitches

### Managed Services
"You focus on scaling. We'll handle hiring, payroll, compliance, talent upskilling, and ensure your hire is hyperproductive with the latest AI workflows."

## Core Value Proposition
**"We believe that although opportunity isn't created equal in the world, sharp, ambitious talent is."**

Our mission is to help connect that talent from all over the world with top companies in the US where they can both grow and make a difference. We're here to help our candidates earn 2-3x more than they ever could in their home countries, and use that to send their kids to school, buy their parents homes, and provide a better life for themselves. At the same time, we help US based companies keep burn rate low as they scale out, all while staying competitive because they're now finding top remote talent vs staying constrained to their local regional talent.

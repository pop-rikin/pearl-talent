## Origin Story & Credibility

Pearl Talent was founded in December 2022 by Isaac Kassab and Monty Ngan. Our founders are immigrants themselves—Monty was born and raised in Manila while Isaac grew up in Venezuela before moving to the US. **Our guiding belief is: opportunity isn't created equal in the world, but ambitious talent is**.

They both started by hiring folks from abroad for their own companies: Monty for an ABA therapy company and Isaac for a property technology company. Pearl was born out of necessity—not profit. The founders built the Pearl process out of hiring for their own companies, focusing on quality and speed.

## How We Work

We have recruiters on the ground in each country that know which startups and local organizations to poach top talent from. We also partner with university professors, incubators, and local vocational training programs where we vet the top graduates from each source. Our co-founders scaled out operations teams themselves and went through the trial and error of setting up proper sourcing, vetting, and retention systems for global talent.

# Customer Pain Points

## Primary Pain Points Pearl Talent Solves

### 1. High Scaling Costs
**Pain Point:** Founders are spending too much money scaling out their organizations

**The Problem:**
- Instead of hiring a customer success person in the US for $55K per year (including FICA and Medicare), companies are paying full US market rates
- Traditional hiring means 100% of salary costs plus benefits, taxes, and overhead
- Scaling teams quickly becomes unsustainable financially
- Limited budget forces companies to choose between growth and talent quality

**Pearl's Solution:**
- Hire exceptional talent for 70% less than US-based equivalent
- Example: Philippines hire at $24K/year vs $55K+ for US hire
- Maintain quality while dramatically reducing costs
- Enable faster scaling without breaking the bank

### 2. Can't Find or Identify Top Global Talent
**Pain Point:** Founders don't know where to find top overseas talent and how to identify who is actually top 1%

**The Problem:**
- Top talent isn't on generic platforms like OnlineJobs.ph, Fiverr, or Upwork
- These platforms typically have second-rate talent used to being paid low rates
- No way to distinguish truly exceptional talent from average performers
- Lack of proper vetting systems to assess international talent
- Time-intensive process to source and evaluate candidates properly

**Pearl's Solution:**
- Access to exclusive micronetworks through top universities and companies overseas  
- The best talent often works for local companies and isn't used to US rates yet

- Pre-vetted talent pool eliminates guesswork and trial-and-error
- Established relationships with talent sources globally

**The Problem:**
- Unclear which roles can be effectively outsourced or hired internationally

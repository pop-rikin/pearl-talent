[First Name] -

Welcome to Pearl Talent!

I'm Isaac Kassab, co-founder. Pumped you're here—means you care about building with global talent ready to scale with you.

**Why Pearl?**

I grew up in Venezuela, moved to the US, and saw how much talent gets overlooked overseas. Monty (my co-founder) and I started Pearl to change that. We connect ambitious people worldwide with companies that want to grow—fast, and for the long haul.

**Our vision:** Make global-first teams the norm.

Whether you're solo or running a 1,000-person org, you get US-level hires at 70% less. No drop in quality.

**What sets us apart:**
- **Premium partnership:** We're your growth partner, not just another staffing agency. White-glove, managed service—sourcing, onboarding, and ongoing support.
- **Proven quality:** Only 2.7% of candidates make it. We pull from top universities and exclusive networks in LatAm and the Philippines.
- **Long-term focus:** 90%+ retention. 90-day guarantee.

Next few days, I'll share how we help companies like Ambience Healthcare ($106M raised from A16Z), Kiwi Biosciences (YC-backed), and 200+ others scale with world-class talent.

Ready to rethink how you build your team?

Best,
Isaac
CEO & Co-Founder, Pearl Talent

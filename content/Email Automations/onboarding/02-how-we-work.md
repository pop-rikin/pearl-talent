# Email 2: How We Work

**Subject:** How our process sets you up for success

---

Hey [First Name] -

Yesterday I shared our vision. Today, let’s get right to how my team delivers top global talent, fast.

**Our proven 4-step process:**

**1. Strategic Sourcing**  
We skip the usual job boards. Instead, we tap exclusive networks: top universities, rising startups, and proven pros in the Philippines, Argentina, South Africa, Colombia, and more.

**2. Rigorous Vetting**  
We run multi-stage assessments including live simulations, skills and culture-fit evaluations, and real-world problem-solving tests. Only the best make it through.

**3. Seamless Integration**  
We handle payroll, compliance, onboarding, and coaching—so you can focus on growth, not admin.

**4. Ongoing Support**  
Our partnership doesn't end at placement. We have weekly check-ins, upskilling, and a 90-day free replacement guarantee. No long-term contracts, just results.

**What you get:**  
Our clients typically experience:
- 70% cost savings vs. US hires  
- 13-21 day hiring timelines (vs. months with traditional 
recruiting)
- 90%+ retention rates
- A return for additional hires after 3 months

This isn't just outsourcing—it's strategic talent partnership. We're building your team for the long haul.

Tomorrow, I’ll introduce you to some of the sharpest people in our network. You’ll see why companies choose Pearl, even when budget isn’t the main concern.

Best,  
Isaac  
Co-Founder, Pearl Talent

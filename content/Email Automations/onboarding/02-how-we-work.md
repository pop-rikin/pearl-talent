# Email 2: How We Work

**Subject:** How our process sets you up for success

---

Hey [First Name],

Yesterday I shared our vision. Today, let me pull back the curtain on exactly how my team and I make it happen.

**Our proven 4-step process:**

**1. Strategic Sourcing**
We don't rely on generic platforms like Upwork or Fiverr. Instead, we tap into exclusive micronetworks through:
- Top universities in the Philippines, Argentina, South Africa, Colombia
- Rising startups and established companies overseas
- Professional networks where the best talent often already works

**2. Rigorous Vetting**
This is where we separate the exceptional from the average:
- Multi-stage assessment including live simulations
- Behavioral and skills evaluations for cultural fit
- Problem-solving and communication tests
- Only 2.7% of candidates make it through

**3. Seamless Integration**
We handle the heavy lifting so you can focus on growth:
- Global payroll and compliance management
- Cultural integration and communication coaching
- Executive coaching for smooth onboarding
- Pearl Coaching & Upskilling bootcamps

**4. Ongoing Success Support**
Our partnership doesn't end at placement:
- Weekly check-ins and performance monitoring
- Continuous training and development programs
- Free replacement within 90 days if needed
- Month-to-month flexibility with no long-term contracts

**The result?** Companies typically see:
- 70% cost savings compared to US-based hires
- 13-21 day hiring timelines (vs. months with traditional recruiting)
- 20+ hours saved in sourcing and interviewing
- 90%+ retention rates for long-term success

This isn't just outsourcing—it's strategic talent partnership. We're building your team for the long haul, not just filling immediate gaps.

Tomorrow, I'll introduce you to some of the incredible professionals in our network. You'll see why companies choose Pearl talent over local hires, even when budget isn't the primary concern.

Best,
Isaac  
CEO & Co-Founder, Pearl Talent

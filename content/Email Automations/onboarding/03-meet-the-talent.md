Hey [First Name],

"This sounds great in theory, but what about the actual talent?"

I hear this question a lot. Today, let me introduce you to the caliber of professionals my team and I work with. These aren't generic offshore hires—they're carefully selected experts who've been matched with opportunities at growing companies.

**Meet some of our talent specialists:**

**Jennifer D. - Argentina**
- 7 years as a Telemedicine Patient Care Coordinator
- Expert in AdvancedMD and healthcare management systems
- Now helping a US healthcare startup scale their patient operations

**Allan C. - Philippines**
- 13 years in insurance billing and claims processing
- Medicare/Medicaid specialist with deep healthcare compliance knowledge
- Currently streamlining operations for a US medical practice

**Simon B. - Argentina**

- Recently placed with a fast-growing tech company to expand their sales team

**Abril H. - Argentina**

**What makes them different?**

✅ **University-educated professionals** from top institutions  
✅ **Proven track records** with established companies  
✅ **English proficiency** at native or near-native levels  
✅ **Cultural alignment** with US business practices  
✅ **Growth mindset** focused on long-term career development  

**Here's what clients say:**

*"The quality of candidates they were able to provide us with was unmatched. The EA we hired had high integrity, problem-solving horsepower, and a desire to deliver excellence."*  
— **Mike Ng, Founder, Ambience Healthcare** ($106M raised)

*"She's not just very intelligent but also kind and professional. She's taken initiative and embodies a growth mindset, which we truly appreciate."*  
— **Anjie Liu, Founder, Kiwi Biosciences** (YC-backed)

These aren't just skilled professionals—they're ambitious individuals looking for career-defining opportunities with US companies. They're earning 2-3x more than local market rates while providing you with world-class talent at 70% less than US-based hires.

Tomorrow, I'll share real success stories from companies who've transformed their operations with Pearl talent.

Best,
Isaac  
CEO & Co-Founder, Pearl Talent

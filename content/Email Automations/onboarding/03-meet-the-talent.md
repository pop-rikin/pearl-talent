[First Name] -

Know you might be wondering—what’s the real talent like?

I hear this a lot, so here’s a quick look at a few of the specialists we work with. All handpicked to match our clients' growing companies:

**Meet some of our talent specialists:**
- **Jennifer D. (Argentina):** 7 years in telemedicine care coordination. AdvancedMD expert. Now helping a US healthcare startup scale patient ops.
- **Lance C. (Philippines):** 3 years in project and operations management. Ex–Shopee. Specializes in project management, data analytics, and process optimization for business operations.
- **Joan M. (Philippines):** 6+ years in account management and SaaS client support. CRM and cloud tools expert. Recently managed client success and process improvement for SaaS and managed service providers.
- **Menna A. (Mexico):** 5 years as an executive assistant. Growth management and international business experience. Expert in cross-cultural communication and executive support.

**What sets them apart?**
- University-educated from top schools
- Proven track records
- Top-tier English at near-native levels
- US business savvy
- Growth mindset

**What clients say:**

*"Pearl was able to get us spun up really quickly and get going, which was great. What stood out was the full service—not just sourcing good talent, but managing good talent too. With Pearl, we were able to see how we could grow as a group."*  
— Josh Ip, Founder & CEO, Ranger ($8.9M raised by General Catalyst & XYZ)

*"There's never any question or gap about who's coming on with Pearl. The communication we have with their client success team is amazing, and they take all the guesswork out of scaling."*  
— Aarika Dunn, Team Manager, Hone Health ($39M raised by Tribe Capital, PIF & Republic Capital)

These are ambitious pros—earning 2-3x local rates, while being at a fraction of the cost of a full-time, US-based hire.

Tomorrow, I'll share success stories from companies who've scaled their operations with us.

Best,  
Isaac
Co-Founder, Pearl Talent

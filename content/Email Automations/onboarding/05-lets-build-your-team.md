# Email 5: Let's Build Your Dream Team

**Subject:** Ready to build your team?

---

Hey [First Name],

Over the past few days, you’ve seen how we work, who we place, and the results our clients get.

**Now it's time to take action.**

**Here's what's possible for your company:**

**Access top 1% talent** from exclusive networks worldwide  
**Save 70% compared to US-based hires** while maintaining quality  
**Hire in 13-21 days** instead of months of searching  
**90-day guarantee** with free replacement if needed  
**Ongoing post-match training & support** to ensure long-term success  

**Ready to get started?**

I'd love to understand your specific needs and show you exactly how Pearl can help you scale. Here's what happens next:

**Book a 30-minute call** where we'll:
- Discuss your current staffing challenges
- Identify which roles would benefit most from global talent
- Create a strategic plan for your next hires

**No pressure, just a genuine conversation about your growth goals.**

**[→ Book your consultation here](calendar-link)**

**Or, if you prefer, just reply with:**
- The role you're looking to fill
- Your biggest staffing challenge
- When you want to start

I'll personally review your needs and connect you with my team within 24 hours.

**Why Pearl? Why now?**

The companies scaling fastest right now aren't limiting themselves to US talent pools. Companies like Apos Health, Julian Capital, and Savage AI didn't wait for the "perfect time". They recognized that the best talent isn't constrained by geography—and neither should your growth be.

Your perfect team is out there. The question isn't whether you can afford to hire world-class global talent. The question is: can you afford not to?

Let's make it happen.

Best,
Isaac  
Co-Founder, Pearl Talent

P.S. I've personally helped 200+ companies navigate this decision. If you still have questions, reply with your concerns and I'll address them personally.

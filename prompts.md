## Content Generation System for Hiring Articles

### Project Overview
The project focused on creating a content generation system for hiring-related articles, specifically for administrative roles. The system includes:

1. **Initial Setup**
- Created templating system using Python with Jinja2
- Established folder structure: content/roles.json, content/templates/article_template.md, content/generated/
- Created Python script (generate_content.py) for content automation

2. **Template Evolution**
- Started with technical template based on front-end engineering
- Pivoted to administrative roles
- Restructured template based on Arc's hiring page structure
- Adapted template for non-technical roles

3. **Roles Defined**
- Virtual Assistant
- Executive Assistant
- Personal Assistant
- Administrative Support Assistant
- Research Assistant

4. **Content Structure**
- Detailed role descriptions
- Expertise areas
- Experience levels
- Salary ranges (LATAM vs US)
- Interview questions
- Job description templates
- Skills requirements
- Onboarding processes

4. **Article Expansion Request**
```
ok but we've left most of the article as headlines and bullets. I'd like to keep bullets for easy readability where it makes sense but otherwise let's write out the whole article - our target is always ~2000 words
```

5. **Prompts File Creation Request**
```
is it possible to create a file called prompts.md and store every single prompt I provide in this project?
```

## AI-Powered Competitive Intelligence System

### Project Overview
Development of an OpenAI/Claude + Firecrawl MCP integration for automated competitive analysis and gap identification.

### Development Prompts

1. **Initial Competitive Intelligence Request**
```
let's do the OpenAI/Claude API integration - but specifically the part where we use OpenAI/Claude to look at our competitors and analyze for Gaps/Opportunities
```

### System Features Built
- **Firecrawl MCP Integration**: Real-time competitor website scraping
- **AI Analysis Pipeline**: OpenAI/Claude-powered gap analysis
- **Battle Card Generation**: Automated sales enablement materials
- **Knowledge Base Updates**: Automatic competitive intelligence documentation
- **Monitoring System**: Scheduled competitor tracking and alerts

### Files Created
- `scripts/competitive_intelligence.py` - Full production system
- `scripts/competitive_demo.py` - Demo/training version
- `scripts/live_competitive_analysis.py` - Live implementation
- `Knowledge Base/03-competitors/vs-toptal-live-analysis.md` - Real analysis example
- `Knowledge Base/03-competitors/competitive-intelligence-implementation-guide.md` - Setup guide

### Real-World Results
Successfully scraped and analyzed Toptal.com to identify:
- Positioning gaps (generic "top 3%" vs exclusive networks)
- Service model differences (self-service vs white-glove)
- Geographic opportunities (broad vs specialized markets)
- Pricing advantages (transparent vs undisclosed fees)
